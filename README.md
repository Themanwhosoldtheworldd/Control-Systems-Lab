# Control-Systems-Lab
A repo dedicated to all the lab sessions from my control theory class.
The laboratory was about controlling an Electric Motor using Arduino and MATLAB. The reports are all in greek.
##
The First Lab was all about taking measurements from the motor itself, in order to determine System Parameters.
##
The Second Lab was about implementing a Linear State Feedback controller.
##
The Third Lab was about Dynamic State Feedback so we can eliminate disturbances.
##
The Fourth lab was about implementing an Observer.
