# Control-Systems-Lab
A repo dedicated to all the lab sessions from my control theory class.
The laboratory was about controlling an Electric Motor using Arduino and MATLAB
##
The First Session was all about taking measurements from the motor itself, in order to determine system parameters.
##
The Second Lab was about implementing a linear state feedback controller.
##
The Third Lab was about Dynamic State Feedback so we can eliminate disturbances.
##
The fourth lab was about implementing an observer.
